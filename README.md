About Stackdriver Monitoring
----------------------------

[Stackdriver Monitoring][stackdriver-monitoring] provides visibility into the performance, uptime, and overall health of cloud-powered applications. Stackdriver collects metrics, events, and metadata from Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services, hosted uptime probes, application instrumentation, and a variety of common application components including Cassandra, Nginx, Apache Web Server, Elasticsearch, and many others.

See the [Monitoring client library docs][monitoring-client-lib-docs] to learn how to use this client library.

Getting Started
---------------
#### Prerequisites
You will need a [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/) project with the Stackdriver Monitoring API enabled. [Follow these instructions](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects) to get your project set up. You will also need to set up the local development environment by [installing the Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/) and running the following commands in command line: `gcloud auth login` and `gcloud config set project [YOUR PROJECT ID]`.

#### Installation and setup
You'll need to obtain the `google-cloud-monitoring` library.  See the [Quickstart](#quickstart) section to add `google-cloud-monitoring` as a dependency in your code.

Troubleshooting
---------------

To get help, follow the instructions in the [shared Troubleshooting document](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-common/blob/master/troubleshooting/readme.md#troubleshooting).
